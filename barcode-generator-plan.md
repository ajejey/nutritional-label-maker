- Small business owners
- Packaging designers
- Compliance officers
- E-commerce sellers

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (existing)
- **Barcode Generation Library**: bwip-js (primary) with JsBarcode as fallback
- **Image Processing**: Sharp for server-side image manipulation
- **Export Formats**: SVG, PNG, PDF, and JPG

### Barcode Types to Support

#### Phase 1 (MVP)
- **UPC-A**: Standard retail barcode in the US
- **EAN-13**: International standard for retail products
- **QR Code**: For consumer engagement and digital linking

#### Phase 2
- **GS1-128**: For logistics with additional data (expiration dates, batch numbers)
- **ITF-14**: For shipping cartons and cases
- **Data Matrix**: For small packaging with limited space

#### Phase 3
